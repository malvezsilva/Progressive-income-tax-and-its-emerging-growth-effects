Here you can find the source code of simulations used in the paper. It is an agent-based stock-flow consistent model (AB-SFC)

Here is the abstract of the paper

In this work, we apply an agent-based stock-flow consistent model (AB-SFC) to analyze economic growth differences when establishing different types of taxes on personal income: proportional and progressive. We use an income tax design that only distinguishes two sections of income. This tax design seems to offset the inequality in the lower section of income distribution through tax exemption for low-income households, but not the one generated in the section of higher income. An additional policy is necessary to offset the differences generated in the range of higher-income individuals. In this exercise, there is no evidence of a deterioration of economic growth in the presence of a progressive income tax instead of a proportional one.

We would be grateful for your comments.
